# Navy
Navy is a reproduction of the famous board game Navy

After cloning this repository tpye "make" to generate the "navy" binary.
The particularity of this project is that each player will play on his own terminal.
To play navy, player 1 must execute the binary "navy" followed by his boats map placed in "files/pos1" and give the printed PID to player 2 who will execute the binary "navy" followed by player 1's PID and "files/pos2". (Type "./navy -h" for details).
This project isn't finished, I'll keep you up to date.

Thanks for playing and do not hesitate to give me feedback or/and rate my project !
